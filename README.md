## Building `mpags-cipher`
Compilation of `mpags-cipher` requires a  C++11 compatible compiler
(GCC 8 or better, Clang 8 or better are recommended) on a UNIX operating
system.
Windows platforms with Visual Studio 2015 or better are also expected to
work, but not tested.

To build from a clone of this repository, open a terminal window
and change directory into that holding this README. Then run:
```
$ ls
LICENSE          README.md        mpags-cipher.cpp
$ g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -pedantic -Wshadow -o mpags-cipher mpags-cipher.cpp
$ ./mpags-cipher
```

If no input file is supplied, `mpags-cipher` will wait for user input
from the keyboard until RETURN followed by CTRL-D are pressed.
To ensure the input text can be used with the character sets known to
classical ciphers, it is transliterated using the following rules:

- Alphabetical characters are converted to uppercase
- Digits are translated to their English equivalent words (e.g. '0' -> "ZERO")
- All other characters (punctuation) are discarded

The results of this transliteration are output after CTRL-D.
